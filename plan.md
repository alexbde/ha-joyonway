# Joyonway Spa Integration Plan — P25B85 RS485 Controller

> **Goal:** A Home Assistant integration for the Joyonway P25B85 controller,
> with a model adapter interface ready for future multi-model expansion.
>
> **Repo:** `alexbde/ha-joyonway-p25b85` — independent from upstream
> **Upstream:** christopheknap keeps `ha-joyonway-p23b32` P23B32-only.
> We removed `joyonway_p23b32` from our repo (HACS requires single
> integration per repo). His code remains at
> https://github.com/KnapTheBuilder/ha-joyonway-p23b32 for reference.
> Multi-model umbrella revisit in ~6 months.
>
> **Integration domain:** `joyonway_p25b85`
> **Hardware:** P25B85 + PB554 + Elfin EW11
> **Status:** Phase 4 write support implemented (light + pump). CRC not cracked.

## 0. AI Instructions

- **No PII / timestamps in code.** Do NOT add dates, author names, usernames,
  IP addresses, or any data that could identify the developer or when work was
  done. Dates belong only in this plan file and in git history — never in
  `.py`, `.json`, or other shipped files.
- This plan file is the single source of truth for the AI. Read it at the
  start of every session.
- **End-of-session routine.** When the user says "end this session" (or
  similar), before finishing:
  1. Write any new findings, decisions, or context into this plan file so a
     fresh session can pick up without loss.
  2. Remove redundant, outdated, or already-completed information to keep
     the file concise and the mental load small.
  3. Verify the plan file is self-contained — a new AI session with no
     prior context should be able to read it and continue the project.

---

## 2. Protocol Summary

### Framing

- 38400 8N1, start `0x1A`, end `0x1D`
- Pseudo-escape: `0x1B XX` sequences (see escape table in code)
- P25B85: full-frame unescape. P23B32: tail-only (bytes 55+).
- Frame boundaries detected on raw bytes FIRST, then unescape applied.
- **byte[3]** = payload length (unescaped bytes between delimiters, excluding 4-byte CRC)

### Bus cycle (~600ms total, 12 frames)

Broadcast at `0xFF` every cycle = main data source (~16 broadcasts per 10s).

### Broadcast byte map (P25B85, logical frame after unescape)

| Byte | Content | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| 8 | Model ID (`0x03` = P25B85) | ✅ confirmed |
| **9** | Water temperature (°F) | ✅ confirmed |
| **12** | Pump status (`0x02`=low, `0x04`=high) | ✅ confirmed |
| **14** | Heater state (`0x40`/`0x50`/`0x55`/`0x41`) | ✅ confirmed |
| **16** | Setpoint (°F) | ✅ confirmed |
| **17** | Light flags (bit 0 = light ON, bit 7 = cycle flag) | ✅ confirmed |
| **27** | Pump mirror (same as byte 12) | ✅ confirmed |
| **28** | Activity flag (`0x20` during heating AND UV) | ✅ confirmed |
| 53–58 | Date/time (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) | ✅ confirmed |

### Command frame structure (22 bytes, captured from PB554 panel)

```
Offset  Size  Field
------  ----  -----
0       1     Frame start (0x1A)
1       1     Destination (0x01 = controller)
2-7     6     Header (0x20 0x10 0x3C 0xA1 0x10 0xA1) — fixed
8       1     Pump byte 1 (encodes transition)
9       1     Pump byte 2 (encodes transition)
10      1     Button flag high (0x40=light, 0x80=temp, 0x00=pump)
11      1     Button flag low  (same as byte 10)
12-14   3     Fixed (0x00 0xC0 0x00)
15      1     Setpoint temperature (°F) — current at time of capture
16      1     Fixed (0x00)
17-20   4     CRC (proprietary, not cracked)
21      1     Frame end (0x1D)
```

### Captured command frames

| Action | Frame (hex) |
|--------|-------------|
| Light toggle | `1a0120103ca110a10000404000c00056003031eeb21d` |
| Pump OFF→low | `1a0120103ca110a10202000000c00056007dd2146b1d` |
| Pump low→high | `1a0120103ca110a10604000000c0005600fc1221c61d` |
| Pump high→OFF | `1a0120103ca110a10400000000c0005600735738e91d` |
| Temp set 87°F | `1a0120103ca110a10000808000c00057005aa3207f1d` |
| Temp set 86°F | `1a0120103ca110a10000808000c0005600dd0ff87e1d` |

Key findings:
- Light ON and OFF use the **same frame** — it's a **toggle** command
- Pump commands encode **state transitions** (must match current state)
- Temp commands include **target °F in byte 15** + button flag 0x80
- CRC is 4 bytes, algorithm is **proprietary** (not CRC-32, CRC-32C, Modbus,
  or any standard variant tested)

### CRC safety

- ❌ NEVER send frames with forged CRC (can activate heater — KDy warning)
- ✅ ONLY replay verbatim captured frames from physical panel
- CRC algorithm not identified despite extensive testing (standard CRC-32 polys,
  reflected/non-reflected, various init/xor combinations, Modbus CRC-16, checksums)
- For arbitrary temperature setpoints, CRC must be cracked or frames captured

### Write support entities (Phase 4)

| Entity | Platform | Type | Action |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| Light | switch | on/off | Sends toggle when state needs changing |
| Pump cycle | button | press | Advances pump: off→low→high→off |
| Pump off | button | press | Turns pump off (handles low→high→off if needed) |

### Entity translations use `translation_key`

Entity names come from `translations/*.json` under `entity.<platform>.*` keys.

### Live-validated (Phase 2-3)

- ✅ Integration installs via HACS custom repo
- ✅ Config flow connects to EW11 and creates device
- ✅ All read sensors work (water temp, setpoint, pump, light, heater, UV)
- ✅ German/English/French translations work

### Write support — NOT YET LIVE TESTED

- ⚠️ Light switch: implemented, needs live test at spa
- ⚠️ Pump buttons: implemented, needs live test at spa
- Temperature: blocked on CRC (only 86°F/87°F frames available)

## 4. Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1. Capture tools | ✅ Done | `guided_capture_38400.py`, `frame_parser_38400.py` |
| 2. Integration | ✅ Done | Deployed, reading live data, HACS install works |
| 3. Validate byte map | ✅ Done | All byte positions confirmed from captures |
| 4. Write commands | ✅ Implemented | Light + pump replay; temp blocked on CRC |
| 5. Live test writes | **Next** | Test light switch and pump buttons at spa |
| 6. Temperature control | Blocked | Need CRC algorithm or more captures |
| 7. Polish & release | Planned | After Phase 5+6 |

---

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Live test write commands** — restart HA with new code, test light switch
   and pump buttons. Verify state updates after commands.
2. **Capture ALL temperature commands** — build a lookup table (30 frames):
   ```bash
   python3 tools/capture_temp_commands.py   # 30 presses UP from 10°C
   ```
   - Display steps in **1°C increments** (≈2°F per press), 30 presses total
   - Script is fully automated: press Enter once, then press UP on each prompt
   - ~15s per step × 30 steps = ~8 minutes
   - Set spa to 10°C (50°F) before starting
   - Captures saved to `captures_temp/temp_commands.json` (resumable)
   - Command frames encode target °F in byte[15]; direction doesn't matter
   - Only UP direction needed (frame is determined by target, not direction)
3. **Implement temperature control** — once lookup table is complete, add a
   `climate` entity (preferred for beautiful thermostat card in dashboards):
   - `hvac_modes=[HEAT]` (spa always heats to setpoint)
   - `current_temperature` → water temp sensor (byte 9)
   - `target_temperature` → setpoint (byte 16), sends matching frame from lookup
   - `min_temp=10`, `max_temp=40`, step 1°C
   - Alternative: `water_heater` (better semantic fit, worse dashboard cards)
   - Decision: go with `climate` for the visual UX (thermostat ring card)
4. **PR to frame-analyzer** — add P25B85 preset to christopheknap's tool
5. **Polish** — version bump, README update, HACS release

## 6. Technical Notes for Next Session

- **`.env` file** holds bridge IP (gitignored). Tools auto-load it.
- **HACS** requires single integration per repo.
- **Restart required** after any code change to the integration.
- **Entity names** come from `translation_key` + translation files.
- **Tests** run with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (96 tests, <1ms).
- **CRC status**: Definitively NOT CRC-32 of any kind. Proved by exhaustive
  brute-force of all 2^32 polynomials (reflected + normal, both endianness,
  all byte ranges, all init/xor combinations). Also not CRC-16/Modbus,
  XOR, or mod-256. The algorithm is proprietary (custom hash or scramble).
  **Cracking is not feasible without firmware disassembly.**
  → Use lookup table approach (capture one frame per temperature).
- **Temperature capture script** ready: `tools/capture_temp_commands.py`
  - 1°C steps (≈2°F per press), 30 presses UP from 10°C to 40°C
  - Only UP direction needed: command encodes target °F, not direction
  - Resumable: saves to `captures_temp/temp_commands.json`
  - ~8 min total for full lookup table
- **Command send pattern**: coordinator opens TCP, writes frame, closes.
  Uses `asyncio.Lock` to prevent concurrent sends.
- **Pump state machine**: must follow OFF→low→high→OFF cycle.
  "Pump off" button handles low→high→off with 1s delay between frames.
- **Light is a toggle**: same frame for on and off. Switch entity checks
  current state before sending to avoid double-toggle.
